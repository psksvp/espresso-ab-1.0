This espresso source files have been patched so that it can be compiled with gcc 4.2.1 distributed with xcode 8 and gcc 5.4.0 on ubuntu 16.04. Below is the readme from the original author where I cloned these source files from.

This distribution is just a reworked version of the c. 1989 Berkeley
espresso source code.  All I've done is cut the number of files down
to just what is required for a modern POSIXy OS and made those files
more ISO-C compliant.  This should make building espresso a little
easier in these more standards compliant times.

See the file COPYING for the original code licence.  All kudos to the
original authors.

The pla for minterm List(0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 9, 11, 15) with 4 predicates (p0 ,p1, p2, p3) looks like below. .e indicates the end of input and output.

      -----------------------------
      .i 4
      .o 1
      0000 1
      0001 1
      0010 0
      0011 1

      The output is below, which indicates the simplify terms [[!p1, !p2], [p2, p3]] --> ((!p1 || !p2) && (p2 || p3)) from -00- and --11
